Project Description: Music Store Analysis using PostgreSQL
Overview:
This project involves performing an in-depth analysis of a music store's database to extract meaningful insights and answer business questions. The database contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, genres, albums, artists, playlists, and invoice lines. The goal is to use SQL queries to analyze sales, customer behaviors, and track popular trends.


Objectives:
Customer Analysis: Identify spending habits and preferences of customers.
Sales Analysis: Determine sales trends across different genres, artists, and countries.
Track Analysis: Evaluate the popularity and performance of different tracks.
Artist and Album Analysis: Analyze the performance of artists and their albums.
Playlist Analysis: Understand the composition and popularity of playlists.


Key Queries and Analysis:
1. Customer Spending by Artist:
    Query to determine how much each customer has spent on specific artists.
2. Popular Genre by Country:
    Query to find the most popular music genre in each country based on purchase quantity.
3. Top Customer by Country:
    Query to find the top spending customer in each country.
4. Top Selling Artists:
    Query to find the artists with the highest number of tracks sold.
5. Sales by Genre:
    Query to find the total sales amount for each genre.
6. Top Customers by Track Purchases:
    Query to list the top customers based on the number of tracks purchased.
7. Average Track Length by Genre:
    Query to determine the average length of tracks for each genre.
8. Total Sales by Country:
    Query to find the total sales amount for each billing country.
9. Tracks per Playlist:
    Query to find the number of tracks in each playlist.
10. Top Selling Album:
    Query to find the most popular album based on the number of tracks sold.


Database Schema:
Customer: Information about customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, etc.)
Invoice: Invoices generated for purchases (invoice_id, customer_id, total, billing_country, etc.)
InvoiceLine: Details of each line item in invoices (invoice_line_id, invoice_id, track_id, unit_price, quantity)
Track: Details of tracks available in the store (track_id, name, album_id, genre_id, milliseconds, unit_price)
Genre: Different genres of music (genre_id, name)
Album: Information about albums (album_id, title, artist_id)
Artist: Information about artists (artist_id, name)
Playlist: Information about playlists (playlist_id, name)
PlaylistTrack: Mapping of tracks to playlists (playlist_id, track_id)


Tools and Technologies:
PostgreSQL: Database management system for storing and querying the music store data.
SQL: Structured Query Language for data manipulation and retrieval.
pgAdmin: A tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.


Expected Outcomes:

Insights into customer preferences and behaviors to aid marketing strategies.
Identification of top-performing tracks and playlists to curate better recommendations for customers.
This project will provide comprehensive insights into the operations of the music store and inform decision-making processes for improving sales and customer satisfaction.
